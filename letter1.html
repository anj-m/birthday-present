    <p>Ello Pooks</p>

    <p>Like I said before I am a thought daughter so here are some of my thoughts for you.</p>

    <p>Originally I didn‚Äôt have this letter planned but it felt kinda right and it‚Äôs nothing new this is all stuff I‚Äôve kinda already said but I guess I just want to reaffirm and hopefully mend any scars.</p>

    <p>You say that it feels like I don't want you to be friends with other people - everytime you've said that I‚Äôve gotta be honest pooks I realised you've never understood me in that aspect. I am content with you being connected with others, please be friends with others but please also be honest about your connections.</p>

    <p>This next part is gonna sound helllaaaa cringe but I‚Äôm saying it anyway. I do make jokes that I have not that many friends but lowkey I do bro. I think I have more than enough to keep me satisfied - I definitely got the normal adult struggles of finding time for all of them so that means a lot of the time I ain‚Äôt hanging out with anybody but anyway point is yeahhhh I definitely have more than enough friends and I‚Äôm very grateful for that.</p>

    <p>Nowww as you have mentioned you‚Äôre definitely putting yourself out there more and I think your friend group is growing too. I want to apologise for anytime I made it seem like that is not something you‚Äôre allowed to do because that is very very far from the case (also bro why would you ever let me dictate that just tell me to F off). I think most of it comes from you misunderstanding where I‚Äôm coming from and what my issues have been with you previously.</p>

    <p>The reason I mentioned the fact that I have more than enough friends of my own is so you understand that is not even including you, I hope you don‚Äôt feel tethered to me - I have plenty of satisfaction on my own so I would never wanna restrict you from having the same thing - that will never ever be my intention (my issues usually were about the things you say sometimes which didn‚Äôt align with the actions I happened to see and pretty much nothing to do with your friends but this letter is not about that).</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm pretty grateful you got this new role as BD because highkey especially in Redback I think it‚Äôs kinda pushed you to build connections with people you might not have before - not saying all your connections have been at Redback but you know what I mean. I think you can be a pretty cool person and a very nice friend and when it comes down to it I will glaze you in front of others cause you deserve it but honestly I don‚Äôt even think you need that cause people can see the good in you pretty clearly.</p>

    <p>Look I know not every friendship is perfect, I know Madu does your head in sometimes but hey I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs also fun with her like she did help you pick out your clothes bro (icl I can never tell if you consider Madu your friend or not). I know only some friendships have substance behind them too like I think your friendship with Shady and Kevin probably has a good amount of substance because I know you‚Äôve had moments you‚Äôll cherish a lot with them and I honestly think they‚Äôre two people who would probably have the time for you whenever you needed it - and then obviously your relationships with substance as you have said has been a little easier with the girls like Steph, Haya, idk how close you are with Ella but maybe her too.</p>

    <p>I know your closest friend right now is Haya (see how I said ‚Äúright now‚Äù you little weasel, I know Steph is your closest friend but there‚Äôs a difference between who‚Äôs your closest friend right now and who you have the most sentiment for, i.e. at one point Tash was probably your closest friend and then it was probably me but Steph was always the one with the most sentiment).</p>

    <p>So I kinda wanna glaze Haya specifically for a second. With the little I know about her I know she's stubbornly kind and caring, a selfless person that has bounds of empathy for others, an optimist who's relentlessly strong because she will have a smile on her face regardless of how down she may feel, a person that's capable of making people feel loved at every moment, hard-working and driven with unwavering ambition, has a heart full of passion that's so easy to see in her work at uni, the things she does for her heritage, the things she does for Redback and all her other hobbies.</p>

    <p>I really do like Haya and I'm way too shy to tell her this myself but I do look at her with a lot of admiration, she's very incredible (so incredible that she's definitely out of your league hehe JUST KIDDDINGGG THAT WAS A JOKE I SWEAR IT WAS A JOKE YOU KNOW IM BORDERLINE A MISANDRIST BRO I HAD TO MAKE IT IM SORRY)</p>

    <p>I also know with you two specifically, that is someone you can lean on emotionally Jonathan, someone that you can go to for comfort and substance, someone that makes you feel excited to see them and someone that you actively want to be around, someone you can be connected to more than with anyone else - I know your Egyptian side is very important to you and to Haya too - that connection you share is something very special and not something you find in many other places (i.e. that is something we will never share, like yes we could learn and admire but I meannn let's be real your understanding of my culture really does start and end at mango lassi and fuckass bUtTeR CHicKeN - say that in the accent btw). SO I FLIPPING GET YOUR FRIENDSHIP BRO OFC I GET IT!!!!!</p>

    <p>All I'm getting at is I think you're building very unique and special connections with people in general, but ofc especially with Haya and from the bottom of my heart I really do think that is beautiful and the only thing it brings me is joy. I naturally get happy for others and you are not an exception. Despite all my sarcasm and bullying (deserved üòÄ) I love you dearly and anything that makes you happy makes me happy too. Your happiness honestly might matter a little more than others sometimes because to be perfectly honest I have always had a huge soft spot for you.</p>

    <p>I know I joke about you being my son but the soft spot I have where I love you so easily like it's inherently in me and want you to succeed in everything you do, really does make me feel like you're my actual son hahaha. I really really do love to see you thrive you make me proud in all things you do, especially the way you are constantly growing and bettering yourself despite all the obstacles that the world has thrown at you. I think you are an incredible person Jonathan and that will never change - even 50 years from now I can so confidently say I will be feeling the same respect for you that I have now.</p>

    <p>I love you and I love watching you grow, I never ever want to restrict you. I hope you‚Äôre honest with me too - l can‚Äôt lie there is a little confusion on my end on how I can best let you grow and how to avoid you thinking that I don‚Äôt like that you‚Äôre growing. I hope this letter kinda helped ease that thought in your head - I really can‚Äôt pull this stuff out of my ass so these aren‚Äôt lies this is genuinely what I think (born to be a gatekeeper, forced to spill the beans).</p>

    <p>All I really ask for is transparency in our friendship, other than that there‚Äôs basically nothing I can think of that I want from you - maybe before I did, but as I am right now that is all and ofc vibes. So please don‚Äôt think that there is anything I want to restrict you from doing bro I ain‚Äôt your actual mother and I ain‚Äôt your girlfriend there is literally nothing I can or should control about your life - SAME GOES FOR ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR LIFE.</p>

    <p>You mean so much to me and I‚Äôm grateful for you every day. Hope you liked letter numero uno!</p>

    <p>Hope you have a good day! I love you!</p>
