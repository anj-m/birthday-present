  <p>Happy Birthday Jojo,</p>

  <p>Welcome to your 20s pooks, sorry to start you off with an existential crisis but I promise this is an exciting chapter of your life. If you’re reading this before your run — good luck! I hope it gives you all the endorphins you deserve. I hope that runner's high hits hard today!! And if you’re reading this after — well done pooks! I’m really proud of you. I know that must’ve felt great and I’m glad you worked towards this and you get to enjoy a peaceful morning with yourself.</p>

  <p>It’s been really great being able to be part of your life no matter how small. I know things aren’t perfect between us but I hope you know my love for you has not wavered — independent to how you may feel. If I may pour out my emotions for a second I think I can paint a picture of how much you mean to me, Jojo. When a good thing happens you are still one of the people I yearn to tell, when something funny happens at work you are still one of the people I want to go back and tell. I still feel like we could start a conversation as the sun rises and still be talking as it sets.</p>

  <p>You are someone I found home in — I really do think that’s the best part of life. The cruel side of that is though — some homes are not the ones where you stay and settle in for the rest of your life. Amongst all our issues I’ve thought about that sometimes — maybe we were each other’s homes for a while but maybe we weren’t meant to live in it, just pass through it. Maybe that is wrong though and we get to live in this forever but regardless of the outcome I’m glad I got to spend whatever time I was gifted with you and I’m going to be just as grateful for the time I do get with you from now onwards too.</p>

  <p>I know there’s a lot happening in your mind and I don’t know about you but for me a lot of things tend to come rushing in at once on my birthday — something about knowing that day was the beginning of my life brings back every single thought I’ve ever had it seems. With all of those things happening in your life right now though pooks —</p>

  <p><strong>I hope you’re okay,</strong><br>
  <strong>I hope you know that I’m always here and that,</strong><br>
  <strong>I’m thinking of you in every moment and I pray for you everyday.</strong></p>

  <p>I think our hardships are what mould us the most and make us who we are today and I can say for sure that all the hardships you’ve faced, Jonathan, have really helped mould a person of quiet strength, resilient in ways that aren't always loud, with a heart that holds both rain and sunshine in equal measure — someone who, idk how, always manages to keep moving forward.</p>

  <p>I think this is probably the hardest letter I’ve had to write out of the three I’ve written for you — not because I have nothing to say — more because I have too much to say and I don’t think my mind is capable of putting it all down into words. So I’m throwing a lifeline here with words stolen from others (passages from some of the books I’ve had the pleasure of reading).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>“There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people in halves, it is not my nature.”</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I can wholeheartedly say that is how I very much feel about you Jojo and I’m not sure where your feelings lie — if they do at all — but I want you to know how much you mean to me. Not so you can feel tethered to me or feel in-debt to me (please please don’t feel in-debt). I want you to know purely so you know at the end of the day if you need someone — I’m here.</p>

  <p>If you ever do find yourself needing me too and not knowing how to ask or bring it up — start with asking me for a hug. It’s something I’ll never refuse and I know I’ve never been great at solutions or giving you what you actually need so it’s the best thing I know I can do to make you feel that I will always be here — so please Jonathan, always ask for the hug when you need it :)</p>

  <p>One of my favourite books is <em>Kim Ji-young, Born 1982</em> and in this book there's a Korean word I came across called <strong>“jeong”</strong> and the closest word in English to it is <em>“fondness”</em> — but it means a lot more than that. It's about an emotional bond that grows over time, through shared moments, small kindnesses, hardship, familiarity. It’s not always loud or obvious. Sometimes it sits in the background, subtle and steady.</p>

  <p>A lot of the time this emotional bond transcends love — it's something that stays even when people grow apart. I feel that a lot with us — jeong is exactly what I feel when I think of you — not just affection, not just closeness, but this enduring bond that’s formed across time, despite the changes and silences and everything in between.</p>

  <p>There have been moments (and I know you know this) where I truly thought our friendship might fade away, might quietly disappear into nothing. And the truth is, I think I’ve made peace with that possibility. Not because I don’t care, not because I wouldn’t grieve that, but because I can find comfort in knowing that this bond, this <em>jeong</em> — would still remain, quietly, in me.</p>

  <p>I’ve said it many times before, maybe so often that the words sound worn now, but I’ll keep saying them anyway: I’m the kind of person who will be okay knowing that even if we grow apart completely, something meaningful will always live in the space we once shared. That doesn’t mean I want to let go of what we have. Very much the opposite.</p>

  <p>Basically none of this means I'll happily throw what we have away — despite all our recent issues, I did not ever feel that I wanted to give up on our friendship.</p>

  <p><strong>You’re more than worth it.</strong></p>

  <p>I do want to learn to love you in a way that works for our friendship and I don’t have plans myself of going anywhere anytime soon. And even more than learning to love you the right way, I want to learn how to understand you — I like to think that love comes easy sometimes, all it really takes is one good conversation and the rest flows naturally. When you find people you might think are cool, you'll tend to enjoy conversations with them, share in their interests, habits and mannerisms and begin to love them. But to me, trying to understand someone is a lot harder, because it's making a strong conscious decision — it's setting aside time and myself to focus on the other person, to really learn their ins and outs and to know them at their best and even more importantly at their worst. That's where I want to go with you because I really do cherish this friendship.</p>

  <p>Now I don’t know how it is for you pooks — I know I am someone who has drained you quite a bit. I know you’ve had your doubts about me — as you’ve said — from all the way back during your Egypt trip. I know that there is not as much space for me in your life now and that I am not the company you go to as much anymore. I know that sometimes this friendship can feel like a chore and so naturally a distance has grown (I’ll tell you a sneaky little secret hehe — I know that sometimes your words don’t quite align with your actions pooks and there is a little dishonesty there. I know you say things like you only don’t reply when you’re locked in but I know that’s not always the case — like even as recent as last Thursday, I know you had youth meeting but I also know during that time you were on messages anyway; just not replying to me — all of that is okay though because I like to believe there’s no malice there at all).</p>

  <p>People always find new, more interesting connections and that’s a really beautiful part of life and I want you to know that it’s completely okay!! When you get a moment to reflect on how your life has changed over the last year, I hope you find the beauty in all of it — the grief, the ugliness, the discomfort, the pain — it’s all worth it. And that part is not just related to us two but in general — everything you’ve challenged has a great deal to admire about it and every time you overcome something I hope you do that — admire the challenges you’ve come across :)</p>

  <p>Our friendship has had its fair share of rough patches, but I think we’ve kept something real through all of it. And I’ll always be thankful for that. So this is not just your birthday letter but also me saying thank you. For being you. For letting me be your friend. For letting me stay — even when I know it wasn’t pleasant for you. Whatever shape our friendship takes in the future; whether it stays the same, changes again, or shifts into something we don’t yet know — I’ll carry this bond with me forever. And I’ll keep choosing it while I can.</p>

  <p>To close off this horrifically long series of notes I’m gonna steal the words of Neil Gaiman —</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>“May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you're wonderful, and don't forget to make some art — write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself.”</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p><strong>Happy Birthday Jojo! I hope you enjoyed :)</strong></p>
